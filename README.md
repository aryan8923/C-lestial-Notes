# C - lestial 
Documentation Page: https://aryan8923.github.io/C-lestial/docs/index.html#/ 

This is the official git repository for the C-lestial library. C-lestial is a project that I have started so as to learn numerical analysis. It contains notes, codes and demonstrations written in C. I wish to learn numerical analysis as well, so I read textbooks, research articles, etc and upload the notes here.

I will be writing the functions and upload them under [GNU GPLv3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license so you have the freedom to use, change and share the codes for any purposes. The library may not be as good as pre-existing ones, but the goal is to learn and let others learn. I will also be citing resources along with the notes so that the reader can have a deeper look at the topic under study.
